                                    <p> But why do we believe purpose to be the determining factor? Perhaps this simple comparison can illustrate its impact best: Isn’t living life without purpose much like trying to write a book without a topic? The lack of a golden thread to connect the chapters and the absence of having something to impart, will not create a gripping read. And, perhaps more importantly, it will not inspire the writer (you) to commit to finishing the story. You could end up leaving the pages of your life blank because you did not seize the opportunity to give it meaning. As a leader, recognise that you also have the opportunity to purposefully contribute to the chapters of each of your team members’ lives. </p>

                                    <p>Committing to your purpose can result in improved relationships, focus, commitment and meaningful contribution to those in your care – whether it is as a leader, partner, parent, etc. This will in turn help to establish a sense of fulfilment.</p>
                                    <p> The PLS presents the platform to enhance commitment, engagement and fulfilment by helping you to connect with your purpose as a person, as a leader and as a team member. Integrating purpose in all you do means that life and work seamlessly create harmony that encourages meaningful engagement on personal and professional levels.</p>
                                    <p> As input to all the PLS interventions, we use data gained from a number of leadership and culture measurement tools, interviews and candid feedback assessments to identify and address underlying issues that hinder you showing up purposefully.</p>
                                    <p> More than just a discussion about assessment data, the PLS helps participants to plan next actions by way of building a purpose map which they can use to hold themselves and others accountable for making necessary changes.</p>
